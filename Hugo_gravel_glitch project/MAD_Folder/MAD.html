              breeze for her, her parents were kind and loving, and her brother
              was fun to hang out with and pull a few tricks on. During this
              time, she met her close friend, Alex, who quickly became the
              sister that she never had. Several years passed, where Zahra would
              explore some of her own interests, and learn about the excitement
              of going to the range. One day, while Zahra had went to Alex's
              house for a sleepover, her brother Zeph had received a copy of
              SBURB and began to play it. Soon enough, Zahra's possessions,
              family, and even her home had disappeared, leaving only a mere
              crater behind where her house was, as well as the small shed in
              the backyard. Ever since SBURB had whisked away her family, Zahra
              has been searching through every single guidebook, website, and
              forum for a way to figure out what exactly had happened, and how
              in the world she could possibly find them. Until today, when she
              discovered a post online by LA."

              that she sets for herself. She wears her heart upon her sleeve,
              and isn't afraid to take risks. If a situation involves her
              friends or loved ones at stake, she would rather burn the world to
              the ground than lose her friends. She loves trying new things,
              even if she might not be the best at it initially. At her worst,
              Zahra is impulsive, a bit of a know-it-all, and judges herself
              harshly. She knows that she's got good intuition, and if no one is
              going to take action, she certainly will. She usually tries to
              keep a level head, but will often get emotional if the situation
              regards her friends or family, leading her to make rash decisions
              in the heat of the moment. She is her own worst critic in most
              situations if one of her plans goes awry."</a

              parents, Esmerelda and William Kenrith. Both of them are avid
              hunters and would take them to the range for occasional family
              trips, ensuring that their kids were knowledgeable in all of the
              rules of gun safety. Esmerelda works as a lawyer, and would often
              encourage her children to do the best that they could in school,
              valuing high achievement. Their father William works as a dental
              assistant, though he often would fiddle with gunsmithing on the
              side. No matter what, they placed the well-being of their children
              as their top priority, and did whatever they could to assist with
              their children's interests. Zahra loves her family, which is why
              she was extremely devastated when they had vanished."</a

              often go with Alex to see what kinds of interesting things you
              could find at the thrift store, even making a game out of who
              could make the most outrageous outfit. As of now, all of your
              clothing comes from the local thrift store. Sewing & Embroidery:
              You learned how to sew up a few small holes when you had
              discovered that a shirt that you bought had a small hole in it. As
              you went to the thrift store more frequently, you ended up
              learning how to sew a bit more formally. Gunslinging: Before your
              parents' disappearance, they used to go on family trips with you
              and your brother to the local range. You found that you had quite
              the talent for shooting, and you ended up getting hooked on it.
              You currently carry the gun that your father uses, the Browning
              Citora, at all times. Video Games: You would often ask Zeph if you
              could play with him, and though he had initially declined, he gave
              in. He played a lot of FPS and RPG games, and when he figured out
              that your gunslinging talent transferred pretty well to the
              digital scene, he started duoing with you for a lot of online
              tournaments. You even started looking for a few games that you
              liked on your own, and found that you enjoyed Pokemon as well as
              more strategy-based games. Reading: Your old room used to have a
              ton of books ranging from high-fantasy, to sci-fi, to even a few
              more historically accurate pieces. You loved spending hours and
              hours under the covers with a flashlight, reading up on all sorts
              of adventures. The Occult: You've consulted all sorts of mystical
              and occult texts trying to figure out if any of these might be
              able to assist in finding your family. Although they don't really
              seem to be that useful, you keep them with you, just in case." "

              >"Your reasons for playing SBURB are simple. You just want to
              reunite with your family, and find out where the hell they even
              are. It was a Saturday when your life changed. Your parents were
              downstairs cooking up some breakfast, while your brother was
              upstairs playing that new game that had just released. He had been
              talking to you about it for months, and had hyped it up so much!
              You had packed up a few of your things, said your goodbyes and
              headed over to your friend Alex's house for a sleepover.
              Everything had gone fine, you hung out, played a few games, until
              the news reports of the meteors started. You had initially brushed
              it off, but once the reporter had mentiond ""SBURB"" you ran to
              your house in the dead of night, and came to see that the only
              thing that remained was a smoldering crater. You fell to your
              knees, in both sadness and disbelief, before passing out. When you
              awoke in the morning, you found yourself upon the couch at Alex's
              house, as she had trailed behind you when you left, and carried
              you back. The next day, you returned to the crater, and tried to
              search for any remaining remants of your family's existence. In
              doing so, you found that the shed in the backyard was seemingly
              untouched. You entered, and took everything, from the various
              gardening tools that you had made so many memories with your
              mother, to the excess of board games and books that were used on
              family game nights, as well as your father's Browning Citora. As
              time passed, you did more and more intensive researh, scouring any
              websites or guides that even mentioned SBURB. And now that you've
              found this link, it's time for you to find your family."

            first release of SBURB, he was one of the original players who
            managed to survive the meteor's impact along with his coplayers.
            Zeph is headstrong, energetic, and charismatic. He tries making
            friends with literally everyone that he can, and cherishes those who
            he trusts. His chumhandle is LA, luckyAbsurdist. Alex King is
            Zahra's childhood friend, and her family is the one that had taken
            her in after the intial disappearance of her family. Alex is bright,
            optimistic, and bubbly. She cares deeply for her friends, and she
            thinks of Zahra as the sister that she never had. Her chumhandle
