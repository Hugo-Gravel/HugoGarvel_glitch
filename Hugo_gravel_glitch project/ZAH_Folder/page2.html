          >Sitting atop the spare bed in the guest bedroom in which you have
          taken refuge in Alex's house, you stare at the glowing screen of your
          gaming laptop. You can finally start your journey to figure out what
          the hell this game has done to your family. You select the download
          link for the game and wait for it to process. Though before you open
          it up, you should probably make sure Alex is ready for this as well.
          Once you had told her about your plans the first time, she was
          determined on helping you out with this. You walk outside your room to
          Alex's before knocking upon the door</a
