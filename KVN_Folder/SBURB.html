          "Nobody could've expected it, whole chunks of forests burning down
          from a few meteors here and there, neighborhoods getting decimated and
          homes suddenly disappearing into thin air soon before those meteors
          hit. It was something nobody could figure out. That is, until a few
          unlucky people didn't enter in time, when word went around that SBURB
          was on each and every one of those computers that were right at the
          center of the hit. It spread like wildfire about the dangers of this
          game. Leading to it swiftly being axed. The most people could get on
          it without playing were guides. Or being very influential in one way
          or another. All of which seemed to end once the entry process was
          over, or never reaching it."---The New York Times
