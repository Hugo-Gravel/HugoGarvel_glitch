          A young cerulean lad sprints through alleyways, making turns to lose a
          gang of... honestly reasonably mad guys. Who would have known that
          throwing multiple axe bombs tied together (which you have named THE
          AXE NUKE, which is honestly really flammable if you think about it)
          into someone's window would get them pissed. You initially thought you
          could take em on, but after seeing that you were hella outnumbered, ya
          DIPPED.

          <i>What is this lad's na-</i>
          <br />
          Alright, man, we can get the name once I'm done running from the
          greatest ass beating of the year Ok maybe we should get to that
          first</a
