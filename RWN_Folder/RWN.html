              they know him as 'That young fella at my burger joint that stomped
              a kid that was being a jackass for me' or 'Some odd cerulean that
              helped me escape some bullies' or 'The jackass that stomped on my
              morial!'. Regardless of the reason, almost everyone has heard his
              name or soon will! To the average troll, he is always ready with a
              snappy joke or a quick punch. He's gives a 'everyone's third best
              friend' feel and is always ready to help them out!

              >Rwylon portrays himself as a... what do you call a golden boy,
              but on alternia... a rusty silver boy! He constantly finds himself
              in situations where me meets more people to help out or get into
              fights with. He doesn't care for most things, letting things slide
              and forgetting about them. If it's somthing too large to forget,
              he's likely to get into a rageful tone which often leads to
              fights. He lacks discipline, and focuses on using brute force or a
              silver tongue to get himself out of problems. If he isn't able to
              use humor or a compliment to get out of a problem, he'll lie or
              get into a brawl. He's constantly cracking jokes and smiling to
              those around him! When alone, Rwylon doesn't like to be a tough
              guy, and prefers to throw on Alternian-Princess movies (just
              imagine disney) and read really cute romance comics.

              uses now! He also tried to teach Rwylon how to be a proper
              disciplined and horable fighter, though mindfulness and
              meditation. While Rwylon adored the combat training, he despised
              any of the lessons on meditation and discipline.

              selfish. The first (and main) is out of curiosity! He's heard of
              it on the news and wants to know what the hell that game is all
              about, even if that means he's gotta risk himself for it. He's
              also looking for a thrill, as the dangers of it excite him rather
              than push him away. Being able to be one of the first people to
              enter a game that has taken lives looks like a challenge in the
              eyes of Rwylon Heratz. "
